User stories:

As a developer, I will build an app that randomly displays 3 individual products to help me gather info regarding product likability from potential users. 

As a developer, I want to display unique photos while the user has clicked less than 2 times or until 6 unique photos have been displayed because I dont want to bore my users or let them catch on to my game...

As a developer, I want to make the site user friendly so I will allow the user to click anywhere within the general region of the photos.

As a developer, I want to provide feedback regarding the users choices upon reaching 25 choices, this information should be stored in a list or array. 

Finally, as a developer, I want to make my site appealing so users will stay with me over the 25 click requirement!
